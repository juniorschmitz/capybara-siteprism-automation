The project has some automated UI tests implemented using Ruby as the language of implementation. 

The project already uses some best practices on Web test automation focusing on end-to-end strategies.

It is a example project that has the objective of being used for future improvements on parallelization and atomic ui automation topics mainly.

The System Under Test (SUT) used for creating this example on atomic ui testing strategy was the Selenium Automation Practice website, which can be found at: [Automation Practice](http://automationpractice.com/index.php)

The project uses the following stack:
- Ruby language;
- Capybara gem;
- SitePrism gem;
- RSpec gem;
- Rubocop as linter;
